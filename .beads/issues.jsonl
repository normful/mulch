{"id":"mulch-izw","title":"mulch init should be idempotent — re-run initMulchDir even when .mulch/ exists","description":"Currently `mulch init` bails early with '.mulch/ already exists' if the directory is present. This means newly added init-time artifacts (like .gitattributes merge=union line or .mulch/README.md) don't get created for existing projects. The init command should re-run initMulchDir() to fill in missing pieces idempotently, since initMulchDir() already handles all the skip-if-present logic internally.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jayminwest@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T16:31:59.306989-08:00","created_by":"Jaymin West","updated_at":"2026-02-09T16:31:59.306989-08:00"}
