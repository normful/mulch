## [Unreleased]

### Added

- CONTRIBUTING.md with fork/branch workflow, ESM conventions, and test guidelines
- SECURITY.md with private vulnerability reporting via GitHub Security Advisories
- PR template and issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- Dependabot config for npm and GitHub Actions dependency updates
- FUNDING.yml for GitHub Sponsors
- README badges (npm version, CI status, license, node version)

### Changed

- Auto-tag git releases in publish workflow on version bump
- Enabled auto-delete of merged PR branches
- Required CI status checks on main branch protection

### Fixed

- `--full` flag being ignored in `prime` command

### Security

- Hardened against command injection, path traversal, symlink attacks, and temp file races (thanks @burakseyman)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Session-end reminder section in `mulch prime` output — reminds agents to record learnings before completing tasks (all non-MCP formats)
- Token budget for `mulch prime` — `--budget <tokens>` (default 4000) caps output size with smart record prioritization (conventions first, then decisions, patterns, guides, failures, references)
- `--no-limit` flag to disable token budget

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Advisory file locking (`withFileLock`) for safe concurrent writes across multiple agents
- Atomic JSONL writes via temp file + rename to prevent partial/corrupt files

### Fixed

- CI workflow now runs `build` before `test` so integration tests find `dist/cli.js`

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- `mulch update` command — checks npm registry for newer versions and installs them (`--check` for dry run)
- Version check integrated into `mulch doctor`
- `mulch onboard` now uses `<!-- mulch:start -->` / `<!-- mulch:end -->` markers for idempotent updates

### Changed

- Record addressing switched from 1-based JSONL line indices to stable `mx-` prefix IDs

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-11

### Changed

- Standardized on ID-based record addressing (replacing line-index addressing in `edit` and `delete`)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-10

### Changed

- Synced all user-facing messaging across onboard snippets, setup recipes, CLAUDE.md, and README
- Agent prompts now ask agents to "review your work for insights" before completing tasks

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- `reference` and `guide` record types
- Multi-domain scoping for `mulch prime` (variadic args and `--domain` flag)
- `mulch search` command with case-insensitive substring matching, `--domain` and `--type` filters
- `mulch compact` command with `--analyze` mode for finding compaction candidates
- Record deduplication in `mulch record` (upsert named types, skip exact-match unnamed types, `--force` override)
- Optional `tags` field on all record types
- Compact output as default for `mulch prime` (`--full` for verbose)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (lint, build, test)
- GitHub Actions publish workflow (auto-publish to npm on version bump)

### Fixed

- Flaky prune boundary test — `Math.floor` age-in-days so boundary records land on exact whole days

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Initial release
- Core commands: `init`, `add`, `record`, `edit`, `query`, `prime`, `status`, `validate`
- Infrastructure commands: `setup`, `onboard`, `prune`, `doctor`
- JSONL storage in `.mulch/expertise/<domain>.jsonl`
- YAML config at `.mulch/mulch.config.yaml`
- Six record types: `convention`, `pattern`, `failure`, `decision`, `reference`, `guide`
- Three classifications with shelf lives: `foundational` (permanent), `tactical` (14 days), `observational` (30 days)
- Provider setup recipes for Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf, and Aider
- Git merge strategy (`merge=union`) for JSONL via `.gitattributes`
- Schema validation with Ajv
- Prime output formats: `xml`, `plain`, `markdown`, `--mcp` (JSON)
- Context-aware prime via `--context` (filters by git changed files)
