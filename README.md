Structured expertise files that accumulate over time, live in git, work with any agent, and run locally with zero dependencies.

Agents start every session from zero. The pattern your agent discovered yesterday is forgotten today. Mulch fixes this: agents call `mulch record` to write learnings, and `mulch query` to read them. Expertise compounds across sessions, domains, and teammates.

**Mulch is a passive layer.** It does not contain an LLM. Agents use Mulch — Mulch does not use agents.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g mulch-cli
```

Or use directly with npx — no install required:

```bash
npx mulch-cli <command>
```

## Quick Start

```bash
mulch init                                            # Create .mulch/ in your project
mulch add database                                    # Add a domain
mulch record database --type convention "Use WAL mode for SQLite"
mulch record database --type failure \
  --description "VACUUM inside a transaction causes silent corruption" \
  --resolution "Always run VACUUM outside transaction boundaries"
mulch query database                                  # See accumulated expertise
mulch prime                                           # Get full context for agent injection
mulch prime database                                  # Get context for one domain only
```

## How It Works

```
1. mulch init               → Creates .mulch/ with domain JSONL files
2. Agent reads expertise     → Grounded in everything the project has learned
3. Agent does work           → Normal task execution
4. Agent records insights    → Before finishing, writes learnings back to .mulch/
5. git push                  → Teammates' agents get smarter too
```

The critical insight: step 4 is **agent-driven**. Before completing a task, the agent reviews its work for insights worth preserving and calls `mulch record`. Mulch provides the schema and file structure so those learnings land in a consistent, queryable format.

## What's in `.mulch/`

```
.mulch/
├── expertise/
│   ├── database.jsonl        # All database knowledge
│   ├── api.jsonl             # One JSONL file per domain
│   └── testing.jsonl         # Each line is a typed, structured record
└── mulch.config.yaml         # Config: domains, governance settings
```

Everything is git-tracked. Clone a repo and your agents immediately have the project's accumulated expertise.

## Record Types

| Type | Required Fields | Use Case |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `convention` | content | "Use WAL mode for SQLite connections" |
| `pattern` | name, description | Named patterns with optional file references |
| `failure` | description, resolution | What went wrong and how to avoid it |
| `decision` | title, rationale | Architectural decisions and their reasoning |
| `reference` | name, description | Key files, endpoints, or resources worth remembering |
| `guide` | name, description | Step-by-step procedures for recurring tasks |

All records support optional `--classification` (foundational / tactical / observational), evidence flags (`--evidence-commit`, `--evidence-issue`, `--evidence-file`), `--tags`, `--relates-to`, and `--supersedes` for linking.

## Example Output

```
$ mulch query database

## database (6 entries, updated 2h ago)

### Conventions
- Use WAL mode for all SQLite connections
- Migrations are sequential, never concurrent

### Known Failures
- VACUUM inside a transaction causes silent corruption
  → Always run VACUUM outside transaction boundaries

### Decisions
- **SQLite over PostgreSQL**: Local-only product, no network dependency acceptable
```

## Design Principles

- **Zero LLM dependency** — Mulch makes no LLM calls. Quality equals agent quality.
- **Provider-agnostic** — Any agent with bash access can call the CLI.
- **Git-native** — Everything lives in `.mulch/`, tracked in version control.
- **Append-only JSONL** — Zero merge conflicts, trivial schema validation.
- **Storage ≠ Delivery** — JSONL on disk, optimized markdown/XML for agents.

## Concurrency & Multi-Agent Safety

Mulch is designed for multi-agent workflows where several agents record expertise concurrently against the same repository.

### How it works

- **Advisory file locking** — Write commands acquire a `.lock` file (O_CREAT|O_EXCL) before modifying any JSONL file. Retries every 50ms for up to 5 seconds; stale locks (>30s) are auto-removed.
- **Atomic writes** — All JSONL mutations write to a temp file first, then atomically rename into place. A crash mid-write never corrupts the expertise file.
- **Git merge strategy** — `mulch init` sets `merge=union` in `.gitattributes` so parallel branches append-merge JSONL lines without conflicts.

### Command safety

| Safety level | Commands | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Fully safe** (read-only) | `prime`, `query`, `search`, `status`, `validate`, `learn`, `ready` | No file writes. Any number of agents, any time. |
| **Safe** (locked writes) | `record`, `edit`, `delete`, `compact`, `prune`, `doctor` | Acquire per-file lock before writing. Multiple agents can target the same domain — the lock serializes access automatically. |
| **Serialize** (setup ops) | `init`, `add`, `onboard`, `setup` | Modify config or external files (CLAUDE.md, git hooks). Run once during project setup, not during parallel agent work. |

### Swarm patterns

**Same-worktree agents** (e.g., Claude Code team, parallel CI jobs):

```bash
# Every agent can safely do this in parallel:
mulch prime                                    # Read context
mulch record api --type pattern --name "..." --description "..."  # Locked write
mulch search "error handling"                  # Read-only
```

Locks ensure correctness automatically. If two agents record to the same domain at the same instant, one waits (up to 5s) for the other to finish.

**Multi-worktree / branch-per-agent**:

Each agent works in its own git worktree. On merge, `merge=union` combines all JSONL lines. Run `mulch doctor --fix` after merge to deduplicate if needed.

**Maintenance during swarm work**:

```bash
mulch compact --analyze          # Safe: read-only scan
mulch prune --dry-run            # Safe: read-only scan
mulch doctor                     # Safe: read-only health check
```

The `--apply`, default (non-dry-run), and `--fix` variants acquire locks and are also safe to run alongside recording agents.

### Edge cases

- **Lock timeout**: If a lock cannot be acquired within 5 seconds, the command fails with an error. Retry or check for stuck processes.
- **Stale locks**: Locks older than 30 seconds are automatically cleaned up (e.g., after a crash).
- **`mulch sync`**: Uses git's own locking for commits. Multiple agents syncing on the same branch will contend on git's ref lock — coordinate sync timing or use per-agent branches.
- **`prime --export`**: Multiple agents exporting to the same file path will race. Use unique filenames per agent.
